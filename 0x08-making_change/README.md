# Change Comes from Within

## Overview

The `Change Comes from Within` project addresses the classic coin change problem, a fundamental challenge in dynamic programming and greedy algorithms. The goal is to determine the minimum number of coins needed to achieve a specified total amount given a list of coin denominations.

This project explores two primary strategies to solve the problem:

Greedy Algorithms: Suitable for certain coin denominations where a locally optimal choice leads to a globally optimal solution.
Dynamic Programming: A comprehensive approach that ensures the solution is optimal for any set of coin denominations by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
